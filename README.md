# Digital Notice Board

The Digital Notice Board is a simple web application where teachers can post, edit, and delete important notices. Students can view these notices after registering and logging in.

## Features

For Teachers:
- Post new notices
- Edit existing notices
- Delete notices that are no longer needed

For Students:
- Register using name, email, and password
- Login to view posted notices
- Read all current notices on the notice board

## Authentication

Only registered users can log in. Students can only view notices, while teachers have access to post, update, or delete them.

## Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React  
Backend: Node.js, Express  
Database: MongoDB

## Use Case

This project can be used in schools or colleges to manage and share important information with students in an easy and organized way. It avoids the need for physical notice boards or external messaging apps.
